The [Invictus](https://foundation.fandom.com/wiki/Invictus) API aims to crawl data from [Ogame](https://lobby.ogame.gameforge.com/pt_BR/hub) universe frm time to time with purposes of store statistical data over time from player growth ingame. All collected data is originally gathered from ogame gameforge API and stored in a relational database. No data exposed goes against game rules and are intended for statistical and tactical use only.

Currently the only universe (Ogame server) explored is the `br144`.
